Proper collections and strings for PHP

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/matthewbdaly/proper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matthewbdaly/proper)

This library consists of the following utilities:

* A collection class for working more easily with arrays
* An object-oriented string class

It's more of a learning experience than anything else right now, but it might be useful to someone...
